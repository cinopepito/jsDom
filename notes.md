In javascript, we have selector
Selector is tools that we used to select element on the dom to manipulate them.
we have querySelector, we have getelemntby Id or by tagname or byclassname.
We fetch the element and then we modify the element but there is something really important about that. We need to check if our selection was well made. That takes 5 minutes but prevent a lot of trouble.

we use classlist.add to add a class
we use classlist.remove to remove a class
we use toogle to swaap between classes, when the class exist, the toggle method remove that and when it doe not exist, it apply that class, this method is very useful when creating dynamic website with javascript program.
