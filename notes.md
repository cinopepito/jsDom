In javascript, we have selector
Selector is tools that we used to select element on the dom to manipulate them.
we have querySelector, we have getelemntby Id or by tagname or byclassname.
We fetch the element and then we modify the element but there is something really important about that. We need to check if our selection was well made. That takes 5 minutes but prevent a lot of trouble.
